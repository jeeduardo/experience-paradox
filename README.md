# experience-paradox

Trying to gain experience in something if there's no opportunity. 

## Details
Contains 2 folders (so far):

**magento-laravel** - a pet project I'm working (when my youngest child is not on tantrums) where I'm exploring the following:
1. Laravel and VueJS 
2. Verifying if it's possible to still use the Magento backend and get a faster speed from it. 

**Note**: It is STILL a work in progress.

**ratesdotca** - a test that I took on for an application previously. 

**Other Note:**
Fat-free framework looks really interesting, I got surprised when I downloaded it. Maybe I'll do another pet project (???) using this.
