# experience-paradox

Trying to gain experience in something if there's no opportunity. 

## Details
Contains 2 folders (so far):

magento-laravel - a pet project I'm working (when the youngest is not crying) where I'm exploring the following:
1. Laravel and VueJS 
2. Verifying if it's possible to still use the Magento backend and get a faster speed from it. (Because using a customized Magento frontend could be slow unless you have the Infra for it.)

Note: It is still a work in progress. 

ratesdotca - a test that I took on for an application previously. 

Maybe I should rewrite my pet-project? Fat-free framework looks really interesting, I got surprised when I downloaded it.
